strecklistan
============

This is the backend of strecklistan: a simple web-shop.

It is entirely built in [Rust]. The backend uses the [Rocket] web server framework. Database
integration and migrations are provided by [Diesel]. The frontend is built using the [Seed]
framework. [Trunk] is used for bundling the frontend.

Local Development
-----------------

Install the latest version of Rust using [rustup].

[rustup]: https://rustup.rs/ "Rust Installer"

The frontend and the backend need to be individually compiled. See
the guides for each. Or alternatively, you can use docker-compose
for a quick setup.

### Quick setup using Docker ###

You know what to do.
~~~sh
# launch the app on :8080 and launch adminer on :8081.
docker-compose up

# and clean up when you're done
docker-compose down
~~~


### Frontend ###

You'll need `trunk`, and the webassembly compiler target.

Quick setup guide:
~~~sh
# Install the WebAssembly target
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

# Install trunk
cargo install -f --locked trunk

cd frontend

# Lanch a server to build and host the frontend
trunk serve # listens on :8080
~~~

The trunk server will proxy api requests to the backend.
**Make sure the backend is running if you want to try the app.**


### Backend ###

All commands in this section are to be run in the `backend`-folder.

You'll need the Postgres C/C++ client library `libpq`, as well as
`openssl`. Install these via your preferred package manager.

You will also need a PostgreSQL database to connect to. Make sure
that you have one running. For a quick setup you can use docker:
~~~sh
docker run --name "postgres" -d \
	--publish 5432:5432 \
	--env POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password \
	--env POSTGRES_USER=postgres \
	postgres:13
~~~

Then make sure to setup your local `.env`-file with the proper
secrets and database settings:
~~~sh
cp example.env .env

$EDITOR .env
~~~

For handling database migrations you'll need to use the `diesel` CLI:
~~~sh
cargo install diesel_cli --no-default-features --features "postgres"

diesel setup # Create database

diesel migration run # Run migrations, generate rust bindings
~~~

There is some mock data that you can use to populate the database
in the `backend/db_mock/`-folder. If you use the example setup,
the script `populate.sh` will do the work for you.

You can then run the application using cargo:
~~~sh
# Compile and run
cargo run

# Run tests
cargo test

# Automatically recompile and run on file changes
cargo install -f cargo-watch
cargo watch -x run
~~~
